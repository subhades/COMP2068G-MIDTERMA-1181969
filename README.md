<h1>VeggiMedia</h1>
<p>Built in class for COMP2068G at Lakehead-Georgian in Winter 2024.</p>

All provider functions (view, edit, create, save, etc works) (minus saving media when creating and editing - like it does show up with options, only crashes when you hit save) works locally, render is throwing a fit thoguh.
